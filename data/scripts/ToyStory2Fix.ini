; Adjusts the games timing to attempt to fix framerate issues on newer computers.
FixFramerate = true

; Uses the detected game-monitor refresh rate as the framerate cap when FixFramerate is enabled.
; Falls back to the primary monitor during startup if the game window is not ready yet.
; On supported executables, gameplay simulation stays at 60 Hz while rendering can run above 60 Hz.
; Demo mode remains capped at 30 FPS.
NativeRefreshRate = true

; Overrides the refresh-rate cap in Hz when greater than 0 (for example: 120, 144, 165).
; 0 = auto detect.

; Writes frame-timer diagnostics to the debugger output (OutputDebugString).

; Automatically falls back to safer timing modes if an unstable high-refresh state is detected.

; Startup protection window (in milliseconds) where risky frontend timing paths are not used.
StartupGuardMs = 5000

; Enables custom frame timing on frontend/menu paths.
; Leave disabled unless you're actively testing.
AllowFrontendCustomTiming = false

; Allows zero-step simulation on frontend/menu paths when custom frontend timing is enabled.
; Ignored when AllowFrontendCustomTiming = false.

; Allows the selection of 32-bit "true" colour resolutions.
Allow32Bit = true

; Ignores the amount of VRAM when enumerating graphics processors. This fixes the "Unable to enumerate a suitable device" error.
IgnoreVRAM = true

; Allows the copyright and ESRB screens to be skipped immediately with Space/Jump.
SkipSplash = true

; Increases the render distance of the main level geometry to the maximum. Prevents areas of the level disappearing when they are far from the camera. Strongly recommended when using widescreen.
IncreaseRenderDistance = true

; Displays 3D graphics in the correct aspect-ratio when widescreen resolutions are selected.
